# token_why3
A Why3 modelling of a token contract

## A handwritten Why3 input

`handwritten-why3/token.mly` is a handwritten Why3 input.  This is prepared as a preliminary exploration before actually producing Why3 code from the Solidity compiler.

After installing why3, try
```
cd handwritten-why3
why3 ide token.mlw
```

After running some solvers, all goals should be green-ticked.

## (Why3 input generated by solc)

`why3-by-solc` will contain the sources.  Not working yet.
